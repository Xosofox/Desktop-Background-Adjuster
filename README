I use windows 7.
And I have 3 monitors like this: |_|__|_|
The middle screen is the big one, and primary one.
And I want to have a large stitched picture spanning over the three.

BUT WINDOWS OR ATI IS TRYING TO ANNOY ME!!!

The picture is spanning from the primary monitor to the right and then to the left.
Additionally, the monitors have different resolutions and are not the same height.

SO:

This script does some copy/resizing to make the picture fit my setup and converts it like this: http://twitpic.com/1e5au7

Ugly code, but working.

Now I can use this prototype to check out git - and turn the ugly php script into a cool picture-transform-application...
